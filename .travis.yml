# A peculiarity of dependency caching in Gradle means that to avoid uploading the cache after every build the following
# lines must be added:
before_cache:
  - rm -f  $HOME/.gradle/caches/modules-2/modules-2.lock
  - rm -fr $HOME/.gradle/caches/*/plugin-resolution/
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.gradle/caches/
    - $HOME/.gradle/wrapper/
script:
  - ./gradlew build --scan
